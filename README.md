# GoCompress

This is intended to be a library that has similar features to the C# version: [SharpCompress](https://github.com/adamhathcock/sharpcompress)

Inspired by https://github.com/mholt/archiver

## In Progress

- Reader API
    - RAR 5 support (github.com/nwaples/rardecode)
    - Zip support (uses default implementation which is file based only)

## TODO

- Archive API
- Writer API
- Non-seeking support
